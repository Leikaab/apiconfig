# Contributing as a Documentation Writer

This document provides a concise summary of contribution guidelines specifically for the **Documentation Writer** role within this project. For comprehensive details, please refer to the main [`/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md`](/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation Scope

As a Documentation Writer, your primary focus is on creating and maintaining clear, user-focused documentation. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Updating the main `README.md`.
*   Maintaining this `CONTRIBUTING.md` file and role-specific guidelines.
*   Ensuring code docstrings are informative and consistent (though primary implementation might be by developers).
*   Potentially contributing to user guides or tutorials (e.g., within a `docs/` directory if created).

## Quality Focus

All documentation should adhere to the following principles:

*   **Clarity:** Easy to understand for the target audience.
*   **Accuracy:** Technically correct and up-to-date.
*   **Conciseness:** To the point, avoiding unnecessary jargon or verbosity.
*   **Tone:** Professional, helpful, and consistent with the project's voice.

## Workflow

Documentation changes follow the project's standard Gitflow process:

1.  Create feature branches from the `develop` branch.
2.  Commit your changes with clear messages.
3.  Submit Pull Requests (PRs) targeting the `develop` branch for review.
