# Code Reader Contribution Summary

This document provides a concise summary of contribution guidelines relevant to the **Code Reader** role. For comprehensive details, please refer to the main [`/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md`](/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Key Considerations for Code Readers:

1.  **Project Context:**
    *   Accurate code analysis and summarization depend on understanding the project's structure.
    *   Familiarize yourself with the overall plan outlined in `apiconfig-project-plan.md` and how it's reflected in the codebase organization.

2.  **Code Standards Awareness:**
    *   The project enforces specific code style (Black, Flake8, isort) and type checking (Mypy) standards.
    *   While not enforcing these standards, being aware of them provides valuable context when reading and interpreting the code.

3.  **Role Focus:**
    *   Your primary objective as a Code Reader is to provide accurate analysis, summaries, and information retrieval based *strictly* on the existing code and its structure.

4.  **Full Guidelines:**
    *   The complete contribution guidelines, including detailed project structure, coding standards, setup, and processes, are documented in [`/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md`](/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please consult this document for full details.
