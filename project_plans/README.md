# Project Planning

This area houses design documents and task lists for upcoming and finished features. Use these plans to understand the reasoning and steps behind larger changes.

Subdirectories:

- **`finished/`** – completed plans with final implementation notes.
- **`http_exception_protocol_enhancement/`** – design and report for improving how HTTP exceptions accept protocol objects.
- **`protocol_typing_fix/`** – investigation and approach to improving protocol typing for external HTTP libraries.

Each folder contains its own README with further details.
