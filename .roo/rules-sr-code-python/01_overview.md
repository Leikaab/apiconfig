# apiconfig Library Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the `apiconfig` library structure and usage patterns.

## Core Components

The `apiconfig` library is organized into the following modules:

- **auth/**: Authentication strategies (basic, bearer, API key, custom), token management, and extensibility for new auth methods.
- **config/**: API client configuration, provider patterns (env, file, memory), and configuration management.
- **exceptions/**: Structured exception hierarchy for config and auth errors.
- **testing/**: Unit and integration test utilities, mocks, fixtures, and helpers.
- **utils/**: Logging, redaction, URL utilities, and HTTP helpers.
- **types.py**: Shared type definitions for strong typing and extensibility.

## Basic Usage

1. **Configuration**: Use `apiconfig.config` to define and load API client configuration from environment, file, or memory providers.

2. **Authentication**: Select or implement an authentication strategy from `apiconfig.auth.strategies` and manage tokens with `apiconfig.auth.token`.

3. **Error Handling**: Use specific exceptions from `apiconfig.exceptions` for robust error management.

4. **Testing**: Use utilities in `apiconfig.testing` for unit and integration tests, including mocks and fixtures.

5. **Utilities**: Leverage helpers in `apiconfig.utils` for logging, redaction, URL handling, and HTTP operations.

## Best Practices

- Use type hints and .pyi stub files for all public interfaces.
- Write clear docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions.
- Ensure 100% unit test coverage and robust integration tests for all new code.
- Follow the projectâ€™s extensibility and error handling patterns.
- Keep documentation and examples up to date with code changes.
