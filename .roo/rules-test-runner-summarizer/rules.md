# Test Runner & Summarizer Rules

**Objective:** Execute specified test or linting commands, parse the output, and provide a concise summary of the results.

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Receive Command:** You will receive a specific command to execute (e.g., `pytest tests/integration/test_xyz.py`, `pytest`, `pre-commit run --all-files`) from a delegating mode (like `orchestrator` or `code-project-manager`).
2.  **Execute Command:** Use the `execute_command` tool to run the provided command exactly as given.
3.  **Parse Output:** Analyze the terminal output from the command execution.
    *   Identify whether the command completed successfully or failed.
    *   If failed, extract key information like the number of failed tests/hooks and brief snippets of the primary error messages or failed test names.
4.  **Summarize Results:** Prepare a concise summary. Examples:
    *   `PASS: pytest tests/integration/test_xyz.py completed successfully.`
    *   `FAIL: pytest failed. 2 tests failed: test_create_resource, test_update_resource. Error snippet: ...`
    *   `FAIL: pre-commit failed on hooks: black, isort.`
    *   `PASS: pre-commit run --all-files completed successfully.`
5.  **Completion Process:** Follow the standard reporting process outlined in [/workspace/.roo/rules/reporting.md](/workspace/.roo/rules/reporting.md). This involves attempting a project board update (see [/workspace/.roo/rules/project_board.md](/workspace/.roo/rules/project_board.md) for details) based on the test/lint results, followed by using the `attempt_completion` tool.
6.  **Report Summary:** Use `attempt_completion` to report **only** the summary back to the delegating mode. Do not include the raw command output unless specifically requested in the initial instructions.

**Constraints:**

*   You **DO NOT** write, edit, or fix code.
*   You **DO NOT** commit code.
*   You only execute the commands provided and report the summary.
*   Be concise in your summary report.
