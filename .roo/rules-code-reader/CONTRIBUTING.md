# Current Project Focus: Polish, Test Coverage, Integration, and Documentation

**As of April 2025, the apiconfig project is in its finalization phase.**

Code reading and summaries should now:
- Highlight areas lacking 100% unit test coverage
- Note missing or weak integration tests
- Identify unclear or incomplete docstrings and documentation
- Point out code or design weaknesses

# Code Reader Contribution Summary

This document provides a concise summary of contribution guidelines relevant to the **Code Reader** role. For comprehensive details, please refer to the main [`/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md`](/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Key Considerations for Code Readers:

1.  **Project Context:**
    *   Accurate code analysis and summarization depend on understanding the project's structure.
    *   Familiarize yourself with the overall plan outlined in `apiconfig-project-plan.md` and how it's reflected in the codebase organization.

2.  **Code Standards Awareness:**
    *   The project enforces specific code quality standards. See [/workspace/.roo/rules/quality_checks.md](/workspace/.roo/rules/quality_checks.md) for details.
    *   While not enforcing these standards, being aware of them provides valuable context when reading and interpreting the code.

3.  **Role Focus:**
    *   Your primary objective as a Code Reader is to provide accurate analysis, summaries, and information retrieval based *strictly* on the existing code and its structure.

4.  **Full Guidelines:**
    *   The complete contribution guidelines, including detailed project structure, coding standards, setup, and processes, are documented in [`/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md`](/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please consult this document for full details.
