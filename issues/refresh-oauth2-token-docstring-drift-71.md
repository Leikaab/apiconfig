## Summary
The `apiconfig/auth/token/refresh.pyi` stub provides a detailed docstring for the `refresh_oauth2_token` function, including argument descriptions, return value, raised exceptions, and a note about the placeholder status. The implementation file `refresh.py` has no function-level docstring, only inline comments. This leads to incomplete runtime documentation and can confuse users and maintainers.

## Evidence
```python
# apiconfig/auth/token/refresh.py
def refresh_oauth2_token(...):
    # No function-level docstring, only inline comments

# apiconfig/auth/token/refresh.pyi
def refresh_oauth2_token(...):
    """
    Refreshes an OAuth2 token using a refresh token.

    This function outlines the standard OAuth2 refresh token grant type flow.
    It constructs the necessary payload and indicates where an HTTP POST
    request would be made to the token endpoint.

    Args:
        refresh_token: The refresh token obtained during the initial
            authorization.
        token_url: The URL of the authorization server's token endpoint.
        client_id: The client identifier issued to the client during
            registration. Optional, depending on the provider's requirements.
        client_secret: The client secret. Optional and should be used
            carefully, typically only for confidential clients.
        extra_params: Additional parameters to include in the request body,
            as required by the specific authorization server.
        # http_client: An instance of an HTTP client (e.g., httpx.Client)
        #     used to make the actual request. (To be added later)

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the new token information (e.g., access_token,
        expires_in, potentially a new refresh_token).

    Raises:
        TokenRefreshError: If the token refresh fails (e.g., invalid refresh
            token, network error, invalid response).

    Note:
        This is currently a placeholder implementation. It requires integration
        with an actual HTTP client library to perform the network request.
        The `http_client` parameter is commented out until that integration
        is implemented in a later phase.

## Impact
- Users relying on runtime docstrings or auto-generated documentation will not see the full contract or expected behavior.
- Increases the risk of misuse or misunderstanding of the `refresh_oauth2_token` function.
- Creates a maintenance burden and potential for further drift.

## Suggested Direction
- Add a function-level docstring to `refresh.py` to match the detail and structure of the `.pyi` stub.
- Ensure future changes to function documentation are made in both files.
