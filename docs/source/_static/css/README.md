# Custom CSS

The `custom.css` stylesheet tweaks the appearance of the Sphinx
HTML theme. It improves the readability of code blocks, tables,
headings and other elements. The file is loaded via the
`html_static_path` setting in `conf.py`.

Feel free to add more overrides here to adjust the visual style of
the documentation.
