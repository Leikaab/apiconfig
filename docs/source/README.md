# Documentation Sources

The reStructuredText files in this directory are the sources for the
Sphinx documentation. Start with `index.rst` which links to the
installation guide, getting started tutorial and the full user guide.
The `api/` folder contains the API reference material generated from
the package modules.

After editing these files, run `make html` from the parent `docs`
directory to build the HTML documentation.
